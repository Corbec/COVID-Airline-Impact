## General Info
This project is the capstone project for my Data Analysis course at the Nashville Software School. The course ran from Sep 2020 to Jan 2021.

## Background
As a former airline pilot that worked for a company that permanently shut down because of the COVID outbreak, I was curious to see the extent of the impact was to the industry. Using data from the CDC, Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), and the TSA, I looked to see what insights I could gain on the impact.

## Data Questions
1. How deeply did the pandemic impact passenger numbers?
2. How did it impact the health of the airline industry?
3. How did it change employment in the industry?

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau
* Excel
